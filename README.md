# AI usage
Explain how you use the AI to solve the assignment. Put all ***your used queries*** in this section & what kind of AI are you using. Declare not using AI if you didn't do this.

On this Assignment i mainly uses chat gpt to understand the algorithm, and also change the pseudocode on the book to cpp. by using that i can implement the algorithm to my code, and i also ask some of the ai for syntax implementation.

here are some of the query that i use:

1. slow convex hull and convex hull algorithm in cpp
2. tolong dari pseducode ini buatkan saya rumus slow convex hall dengan cpp
3. can you fixed the code
4. jelaskan eror ini
5. tolong jelaskan algoritma yang ada di gambar diatas
6. can you fix this slow hull algorithm
7. can you implement it?
8. can you apply it to my code

# Collaboration usage
Explain how you are ***using others*** to complete the assignment in this section. Are they simply copying, learn the ideas, learn how to adapt the AI or anything involving the process. State the people if any & Please be elaborate. Declare self tought if you solved this by yourself.

in this assignment i had a couple of friends that help me. first of all deric and ryan help me understand how to use qt, after that deric told me how the algorithm works, i was  still confused then i collaborated with fikri to make the slow and fast hull cobex algorithm.
